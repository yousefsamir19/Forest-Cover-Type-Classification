# üå≤ Forest Cover Type Classification  

This project tackles the **multi-class classification** problem of predicting forest cover type using the **UCI Covertype dataset**.  
The analysis compares two powerful tree-based algorithms: **Random Forest** and **XGBoost**, along with model evaluation, feature importance analysis, and hyperparameter tuning.

### üìÇ Dataset  

The analysis is based on the [UCI Covertype Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype), which contains cartographic variables such as:  

- Elevation  
- Aspect  
- Slope  
- Hillshade indexes  
- Soil type indicators  
- Wilderness area indicators  
- Cover type (target variable, 7 classes)
